# Grader
This simple java application calculates your GPA based off of certain grades received. The project was made in NetBeans, and it is a simple
GUI application that lets the user put in certain grades for certain classes and it will tell them their GPA, and if they will make it
into the Information Systems Program.

To run the program without Netbeans, open the KoryHutchisonProject2 folder and then open the dist folder to then open the .jar file.
